css-helper
==========

Helper class for CSS that provides class names for different well used elements such as borders, margins, and padding.

This less file is a great accompaniment to Bootstrap's components, making it easier to add certain css features to your site elements.


To Use
==========

Make sure first that you have less installed. Adding this file to your project should allow the less files to compile properly and add the classes to your css file.

If you have a Windows OS, you will need to compile this seperately and add the .css file to your list of css tags in the head of your documents.
